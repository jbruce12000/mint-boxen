mint-boxen
============

My laptop setup using Puppet and basic idea from Ubuntu Boxen.  This works specifically with linux mint.

Look at [the original Boxen](http://boxen.github.com/) to understand what it is and how to use it.

Setup
-----
    wget -O- -q https://raw.github.com/jbruce12000/mint-boxen/master/install.sh | sudo /bin/bash
